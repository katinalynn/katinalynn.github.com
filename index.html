<h1>Katina Rogers</h1>

<p>I'm currently Senior Research Specialist with the Scholarly Communication Institute, a Mellon-funded humanities think tank that operates out of the University of Virginia Library's stellar Scholars' Lab. During my time at SCI, I'll be planning and conducting a broad survey of humanities-trained respondents who self-identify as working in alternative academic careers, to illuminate perceived gaps in graduate-level preparation and help move #alt-ac conversations beyond the anecdotal. I'll also be helping to support and share outcomes from a number of conversations SCI is convening: on emerging models for authoring and publication (with the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture, PressForward, and the Modern Language Association's program in scholarly communication); and on graduate education reform, with CHCI and centerNet. Finally, I will play a role in the planned expansion of the Praxis Program to a multi-institutional and international effort, geared toward sharing model programs and experiments in humanities methodological training.</p>
